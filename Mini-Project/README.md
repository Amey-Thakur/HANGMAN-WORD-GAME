<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

This directory contains the formal documentation and media assets for the **Hangman Word Game**, developed as a 3rd-semester mini-project for the Object-Oriented Programming Methodology (OOPM) course. 

The project highlights the technical application of:
- **Graphical User Interfaces**: Implementation utilizing Java Applet and AWT/Swing frameworks.
- **Academic Documentation**: Formal technical report and scholarly presentation materials.
- **Empirical Demonstration**: Verification of software functionality via recorded media and outcome captures.

<!-- DOCUMENTATION -->
## Documentation

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**WordGame.pdf**](WordGame.pdf) | **Technical Project Report**: Detailed architectural analysis, design schematics, source code implementation, and validated outcomes. |
| [**WordGame.pptx**](WordGame.pptx) | **Technical Presentation**: Scholarly slide deck detailing project methodology, core features, and implementation highlights. |

---

<!-- DEMONSTRATION -->
## Demonstration

The software execution and gameplay flow are documented in a high-fidelity video demonstration, covering the lifecycle from initialization to final state termination.

- **Primary Video Record**: [**Applet.mp4**](Applet.mp4)
- **External Reference**: [Technical Demonstration](https://youtu.be/JsT9KYKPUgs)

---

<!-- VISUAL RESULTS -->
## Visual Results

The [**Outputs/**](Outputs/) directory serves as a comprehensive record of game states, containing 19 unique captures documented during validation phases.

### Technical Record Highlights:
- **Initialization Sequence**: Welcome interface, operational instructions, lexical hint dialogs, and player registration.
- **Operational Logic**: Primary game interface, user input interactions, and lexical verification.
- **Graphical Progression**: Sequential rendering of the hangman figure corresponding to miss-counts.
- **Terminal States**: Academic record of success (Win) and failure (Loss) outcomes.

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed visual previews of these records are available in the main [**Results Gallery**](../../README.md#results-gallery).
