# Archival Governance Statement: HANGMAN-WORD-GAME

## 1. Archival Philosophy
The **HANGMAN-WORD-GAME** repository is maintained as a **Finalized Archival Artifact**. The primary objective of this governance model is the preservation of the project's technical and historical integrity as a representative case study of Computer Engineering coursework (2018-2022).

## 2. Stewardship and Maintenance
- **Curatorial Role**: This repository is stewarded by **Amey Thakur** and **Mega Satish**. 
- **Active Development**: Active development, feature requests, and non-critical logic modifications have concluded. The project's scope is intentionally fixed to ensure consistency in academic reference.
- **Security Monitoring**: As defined in the `SECURITY.md`, the repository is not subject to active security monitoring. It is a preserved record of the technology and standards present at the time of its original implementation.

## 3. Principles of Immutability
This artifact is considered **locked** for the purposes of historical reference. The following rules apply to any future modifications:
- **Functional Logic**: The core Java implementation (source code) is immutable to preserve the authenticity of the original engineering work.
- **Documentation**: Adjustments are restricted to critical scholarly corrections, such as updating broken external references (DOIs) or enhancing metadata interoperability.
- **Authorship**: Authorship and attribution are fixed according to the consolidated record established during the archival process.

## 4. Preservation Standards
The repository incorporates modern archival standards, including:
- **CodeMeta/Schema.org** for machine-readable metadata.
- **Citation File Format (CFF)** for standardized academic attribution.
- **Formal Technical Specifications** to ensure the architectural logic remains interpretable independently of software runtime availability.

## 5. Public Access and Licensing
The project remains open for educational and research purposes under the **MIT License**. Users are encouraged to utilize this repository as a benchmark for pedagogical software engineering archives.
